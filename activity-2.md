index.html markdown
  first 11 lines have to do with character/font sizing, color of display, etc
  <div> contains HTML of id for demo 
  <script> contains code (executablec code)
    then imports "lit" and the js file it is tied to 
    line 18 declares the title as a constant
    render (i am unfamiliar with it, had to look up) refers to displaying content in browser
    document.querySelector is used to retrieve the first matching element of html//i have used this before but i am definitely unsure of how to use it/ define it
    your-element-name.js is what defines the Hello World, allows you to keep same general style with different web pages?
    src/YourElementName.js is where the actual code is where you can edit your code/html
    lit is a very fast and efficient way of writing html templates with javascript, provides css style to use, provides library of sources/ templates
